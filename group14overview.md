|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
|27/Jan/2023|I further understood the plan for completing the user story with my partner. I helped create some table attributes for the student form section in the ERD.|Hopefully get started on the coding parts for the form.|Not currently.|
|30/Jan/2023|Started working in student form branch. Had 2 coding sessions with partner where we also discussed ideas. I worked on student model class, studentValidator and the repository.|Will resume working on Wednesday where I will carry on coding the validation of student form inputs.|Realised we can't just rely on the excel sheet as it is different to the form layout, so this affects the existing erd diagram, where tables were based off certain sections. My partner and Chia/Ervin have been redesigning the erd tables. So our student form java classes will need to store more details.|
|31/Jan/2023|Attended the 2 lectures and learnt useful information such as how we are being marked, work we need to submit at certain points (Demos, user journal) and further.|Will continue working on project on Wednesday. Using today to catch up with other modules.|Tomorrow's timetabling for labs is a bit iffy as we're all mixed up. So I'll aim to attend from 9 to 1 (my partner has 9 oclock slot). Concerned about if we picked the user stories in order of priority (based off yesterday's lecture)|

|06/Feb/2023|Worked on validations and making adjustments throughout the code for it Started testing with partner and helping change code in response to errors.|Carry on testing and checking all validation works correctly.

|07/Feb/2023|Fixed some validation errors, tested code and amended some code.Started comments so our user story can match definition of done.|Help with the merging and any problems that is caused. Finish comments/documentation, code style fixes(indents)Create user manual and record demo.Add screenshots to git.Finish sprint 1 tasks|Need to check all the drop down list values and check it actually puts the correct values in the database e.g. "1" as true for boolean. Then need to fix the corresponding validation for those drop down lists, but that will be done if there is extra time.|
|08/Feb/2023|Created student form user manual.Gather user manuals in a folder. Created a master user manual document. Attended the meeting. Uploaded the panopto demo video. Added documentation.Gave a review of company form. Fixed some of their context problems (labelling and incorrect title names). Did also provide a validation for if user selected yes, they could not proceed without entering something in the further details box, but had to remove from latest version, as in the post validation catching method, it would get rid of the popup box Chia/Ervin made, and I didn't have enough time to figure out how that code works.|Help the features get passed . Try and resolve all the problems identified but not yet solved. Need to finish off sprint 1 task submissions. And take final screenshot.|Other than the above. We also need to plan a meeting for sprint retrospective (sprint 1) and sprint planning (sprint 2).|
|09/Feb/2023|I attended the demo, uploaded the 3rd screenshot.|Attend the retrospective and planning meeting today, and get a user story (preferably one that I can work on myself).|None.|
|10/Feb/2023|Attended the planning and retrospective meeting, picked a user story.|Nothing, will aim to start tomorrow.|None yet.|
|13/Feb/2023|Been experimenting with libraries to use for sending the email. Think the best way (without storing one email and password in the application ) is by using a html mailto form.|Hopefully code this implementation and see if I can make the email that opens after pressing the send button specific to the users work email, rather than showing all the users email accounts on the computer.|None.|
|14/Feb/2023|Figured out the functionality on how to make the emails successful by making model, controller and jsps.|Now add more features for the user such as picking the attribute they wish to request in the form of drop down lists in the isps.|None.|
|15/Feb/2023|Made my user story more presentable for todays meeting, did some research into design solutions and implemented what I thought was the best option.|Hopefully get feedback on my work and start adding the drop down features to construct the email, for the placement team.|None.|
|16/Feb/2023|Finished what I can currently do with my user story (I will have to add extra controller methods that are dependent on how the pending placements user stories is being delivered, but this will be done in the merging and I know which model attributes have to be carried through to my contact page). Did some style additions to make it cleaner. Added screenshot to gitlab. Commited some files to my branch.|Will resume in the weekend.|None.|
|17/Feb/2023|Nothing.|Will resume in the weekend.|None.|
|20/Feb/2023|Committed final files with comments to match definition of done.|Do testing of the user story I was assigned.|I think we've got the meaning of testing and user review stages mixed up. I emailed sir asking for clarification, will share when I get a reply. As I did a bit more research into the scrum stages, and I found that the testing stage is supposedly to iron out any problems, but the user review stage is supposed to be done by the stakeholder (our supervisor). Also, if the above is the case, I don't think the person testing is suitable for fixing the other persons code, as they are not the ones familiar with it, so it is not their responsibility. But we can discuss this further in detail once sir gives his answers.|
|21/Feb/2023|Tested Moaz and Zaina"s user story. Solved errors I found, except the visual problem where comments appear on the Web page.|Create my user manual, demo and review the other user story I have, and upload final screenshot of sprint 2 if we finish today.|No.|
